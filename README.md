## Introduction:
This project is a camera pc game based on python opencv.  
The project is a self-made project that uses a camera and face recognition technology.

## Game description:
The game simulates the "Try not to laugh!" Challenge.  
A funny fails video is played on the screen, and the player's goal is not to laugh or smile.  
The player has an HP scale, and whenever the player laughs - his HP is reduced accordingly.  
The calculation of "Is the player laughing?" Is made by an algorithm.  
The algorithm works in such a way that it calculates the distance ratio of the ends of the player's mouth.  
When the player starts to smile the distance between the edges of their mouth increases.  
And when it hits a certain distance we know the player is laughing.
